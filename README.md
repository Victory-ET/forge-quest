## Overview

QuestForge is a comprehensive engagement platform that combines community milestone tracking with interactive quests, powered by Zora Coins. It creates a two-way engagement ecosystem where creators can set collective goals for their communities while fans complete individual and group challenges to earn rewards and drive creator growth.

## Problem Statement

Creators face two critical challenges in the web3 space:
1. **Maintaining engagement between drops** - There's often a drop-off in community activity between major launches
2. **Disconnected growth mechanisms** - Fan actions that help grow the creator's presence aren't directly rewarded or gamified

QuestForge addresses both issues by creating a complete engagement loop:
- Creators set community milestones that unlock rewards when reached
- Fans complete quests that earn them coins and help achieve these milestones
- Achieved milestones create positive feedback and deeper community investment
